   </h3>
  <p class="number1">Graphic Design,design that goes everywhere, the art of communication with visual symbols, graphic design is all that. <br> Graphic Design is words, and colors and vectors and images, its photoshop, and book cover, movie posters and fonts. Graphic Design is magical and useful.</p>

    <h3 class="number1">-Sculpting-</h3>
    <p class="number1"> It starts with a box, paper and glue, it starts with a rip and tear, cutting and soaking, it starts by destroyong the integry of the cardboard. <br> Then with foil and tape and cardboard you shape a shape of structue to sculpt upon. <br> This putty wet paper and glue soaked cardborad you dig your fingering into the face, the arm, the ear and produce volume as the cardboard drys. <br> Once it has dryed and the hot glue is not hot, once the cardboard becomes hard, you step back and stare back at a face.  </p>

    <h3 class="number1"> -Adobe- </h3>
    <p class="number1">I appreciate Adobe's Creative Suite for its comprehensive tools that empower digital creativity. <br> Their software like Photoshop and Illustrator are industry standards, enabling professionals and hobbyists alike to bring their visions to life.</p>

        <h3 class="number1">-H&M-</h3>
        <p class="number1">H&M stands out for its affordable fashion that doesn't compromise on style.
   <br> I admire their efforts towards sustainability, including their Conscious Collection, <br>
    which demonstrates a commitment to reducing environmental impact in the fashion industry.</p>

    <h3 class="number1">-Costco</h3>
    <p class="number1">Costco's bulk buying model offers great value for money, which I find particularly useful for household essentials. <br> I also respect their treatment of employees, offering better wages and benefits compared to many other retail chains, which aligns with my values as a consumer.</p>

    <h3 class="number1">-Roc's K-pop Tacos-</h3>

    <p class="number1">RocTacos in Salt Lake City serves up a fusion that's hard to beat. <br> Their Korean-inspired tacos blend the best of both worlds - think bulgogi beef wrapped in a soft tortilla, topped with kimchi and a spicy gochujang sauce. <br>  It's a flavor explosion that keeps me coming back every time I'm in town.</p>

    <h3 class="number1">-Pesto Pasta Salad-</h3>
    <p class="number1">My old neighbor's divine pesto pasta salad is a summer staple I can't forget. <br>
         Made with al dente fusilli, her homemade basil pesto, cherry tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella pearls, it's a simple dish that packs a punch. The secret? No clue.</p>

    <h3 class="number1">-Tikka Masala-</h3>
    <p class="number1">Costco's jarred Indian curry is my go-to for quick, satisfying meals. On busy weeknights,<br> I'll simmer chunks of chicken in this rich, aromatic sauce, serve it over basmati rice, and suddenly feel like I'm dining in a cozy restaurant. <br> It's convenience food that doesn't sacrifice on flavor.</p>
